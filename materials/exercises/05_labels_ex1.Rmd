# Exercise 2

-   {ggtext} also comes with some new geom's. Explore those and other options on the package webpage: https://wilkelab.org/ggtext.
-   **Create the following visualization, as close as possible**, with the `penguins` dataset which is provided by the {palmerpenguins} package( more here: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).
    -   For the species labels, you likely have to create a summary data set.
    -   Use the {ggtext} geometries and theme elements to format the labels.
    -   Also, make use of the other components such as scales, original theme, and theme customization.

## Data 

```{r preparation}
library(tidyverse)

# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

## inspect data
penguins

glimpse(penguins)
unique(penguins$species)
```


## Visualization

```{r plot}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
 geom_point()
```

  
  
```{r i-am-done-what-now}
knitr::include_graphics("img/exercise-what-now-sd.png")
```

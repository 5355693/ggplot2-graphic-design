# Exercise 1

-   Explore the TfL bike share data visually:\
    **create a timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days**
    -   Highlight day and night encoded by colors and shapes.
    -   Connect the points of each period with lines.
        -   What is the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`?
    -   Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    -   Add meaningful labels.
-   Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.

## Data import

```{r}
#| label: preparation
library(tidyverse)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```

## Timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days

```{r}
#| label: plot
bikes %>%
  filter(day_night == "day" & is_weekend == T) %>%
ggplot(data = ., aes(x = date, y = count)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5
  ) + labs(
    y = "No. of reported bikeshares", x = "Date"
  )
```
```{r}
#| label: plot
g <-
  ggplot(
  data = bikes,
  aes(x = date, y = count,
      shape = day_night,
      color = day_night,
      group = day_night
      )
  ) +
  geom_point()  + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Reported bike shares",
    title = "Bike sharing trends",
    color = "Time of day:", ##handy trick for relabeling the legend!
    shape = "Time of day:"
    ) +
  theme_dark()
g
```

```{r}
#| saving a graphic

ggsave(g, filename = "exercise1.pdf", width = 20, height = 12, unit = "cm", device = cairo_pdf)
```

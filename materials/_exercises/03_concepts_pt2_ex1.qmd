## Your Turn!

::: question
* Have a look at the following visualization of the cumulative time that cosmo- and astronauts have spent in outer space. The data also contains information on the year of their first and last travel, respectively.
* Together with your group, discuss which layers and modifications are needed to create such a chart with `{ggplot2}`.
  - Note down the aesthetics, geometries, and scales used for each element of this graphic.
  - What is the coordinate system? Have any adjustments been made?
  - Which theme was used and how was it modified?

# Exercise 1

- Explore the TfL bike share data visually:  
  **create a timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days**
    * Highlight day and night encoded by colors and shapes.
    * Connect the points of each period with lines.
        + What is the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`?
    * Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    * Add meaningful labels.
- Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.
